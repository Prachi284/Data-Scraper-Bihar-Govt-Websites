# Data-Scraper-Bihar-Govt-Websites

During my tenure as a research assistant under Prof Siddharth George, I developed a project that automates the extraction of data from select Bihar government websites. This project generates organized CSV files categorized by district, block, and panchayat names, facilitating efficient data analysis.

**Features**
Web Scraping: Retrieve accurate and up-to-date information from Bihar government websites.
Data Organization: Segregate scraped data into CSV files for easy analysis by district, block, and panchayat.
Customization: Configure the scraper to target specific government websites or data types as needed.
Efficiency: Automate data extraction to improve efficiency and reduce human error.
